# Best-film-directors-map
This map represents the countries of origin of directors of movies rated by 177 critics in a BBC Culture's list of 100 Greatest Movies of the 21st Century.

The rating of each movie corresponds to the rating of each director. And in this map, I focus attention on only directors born outside the US.

A majority of movie directors are US-born. So this map is essentially to look at where other great movie directors of the 21st Century come from and what critics think of them in times of ratings.

In this map, by hovering over each country, you will see how many directors in the list come from each particular country. By clicking any of these countries, you will be able to see who these directors are and what ratings they have been given by critics.

This map is made with Mapbox with scraping of all information relating to the movies and directors done in this [repository.](https://github.com/kfalayi/Scraping-and-mapping-best-directors-rating).
